            With forms, GET data is encoded automatically,
            before it is sent
            
            However, If we construct a URL in JavaScript we must
            make sure the data is encoded
            
            There are a number of illegal characters that could
            ruin our URL (:, &, /, ?, etc.)
            
            If we don't encode it, the ampersand in 'muA&M'
            would make the URL look like this:
            
            process.php?sid=muA&M
            
            That would make for one key/value pair with
            'sid' = 'muA' and 'M' = to nothing
        */ 
        
         // var schoolId = "mu";
        var schoolId = "muA&M";

        function doSubmit() {
            var formObj = document.getElementById("myForm");

            formObj.action = "process.php?sid=" + encodeURIComponent(schoolId);
            formObj.submit();
        }
