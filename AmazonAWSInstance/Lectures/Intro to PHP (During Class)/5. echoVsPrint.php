    <!--
        echo and print are more or less the same thing. They
        both are used to output data to the screen.

        The differences are small but there are differences:
            *echo has no return value while prints has a return
            value of 1 so it can be used in expressions
            *echo can take multiple parameters (although such
            usage is rare) while print can take only one
            *echo is marginall faster than print

    <?php
		echo "<h2>PHP is Fun!</h2>";
		echo "Hello world!<br>";
		echo "I'm about to learn PHP!<br>";
		echo "This ", "string ", "was ", "made ", "with multiple parameters.";
	?>

		$txt1 = "Learn PHP";
		$txt2 = "CS2830";
		$x = 5;
		$y = 4;

		echo "<h2>" . $txt1 . "</h2>";
		echo "Study PHP in " . $txt2 . "<br>";
		echo $x + $y;
	?>	

    <p>Print</p>

    <?php
	/* The print statement can be used with or without parentheses: print or print(). */
		print "<h2>PHP is Fun!</h2>";
		print "Hello world!<br>";
		print "I'm about to learn PHP!";
