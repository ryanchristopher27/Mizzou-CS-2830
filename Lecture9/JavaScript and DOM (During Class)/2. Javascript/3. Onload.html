                After a function expression has been stored in a variable, the variable can be used as a function
                
                The function above ends with a semicolon because it is part of an executable statement like var x = 0;
                
                Both functions do the same thing
                
                Note that a function without a name (like the one assigned to 'pageLoaded' variable in the function expression above) is called an anonymous funciton
                
                Functions stored in variables do not need funciton names, they are always invoked (called) using the variable name
                
                In JavaScript, functions are first-class citizens, that means you can stored them in variables, pass them into other functions as argumetns, organize them into arrays, store them in objects, etc.
